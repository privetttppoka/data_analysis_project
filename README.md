# data_analysis_project
This repository contains a comprehensive project on data processing and analysis, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and anomalies, dataset preparation involving cleaning and transformation, calculation of descriptive statistics to summarize key characteristics, and the implementation of a linear regression model to analyze relationships between variables. The project provides insights into data handling, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling. ðŸš€

**Dataset Description**
This dataset contains information on soybean varieties collected over 5 years from 2 locations (Kuban and Lipetsk) and includes data on approximately 300 varieties. Soybeans are one of the most widespread leguminous and oilseed crops, serving as a raw material for a wide range of food products. Their high protein content and valuable nutritional components make them a cost-effective substitute for meat and dairy products.

**Dataset Features:**
- **id** â€“ Variety ID
- **leaf_shape** â€“ Leaf shape
- **maturation_group** â€“ Maturity group (1 â€“ early-maturing, 6 â€“ late-maturing)
- **lodging_type** â€“ Lodging resistance
- **growth_type** â€“ Growth type (Indeterminate â€“ unlimited growth and flowering)
- **flowering_group** â€“ Flowering group (1 â€“ early flowering, 5 â€“ late flowering)
- **pubescence_colour** â€“ Pubescence color
- **corolla_colour** â€“ Corolla color
- **origin** â€“ Origin of the variety
- **productivity** â€“ Yield (g/mÂ²)
- **vegetation_period** â€“ Period from emergence to harvest
- **protein_content** â€“ Protein content in seeds (%)
- **oil_content** â€“ Oil content in seeds (%)
- **site** â€“ Location (kub â€“ Kuban, lip â€“ Lipetsk)
- **year** â€“ Year of observation
This dataset can be used for analyzing soybean growth characteristics, productivity, and quality under different conditions.
